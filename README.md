## Hey, I am Roman Ryltsov ðŸ‘‹

Software engineer with experience and passion in multimedia. The code I wrote over years keeps working in uncountable systems, including those powering Microsoft Xbox Cloud Gaming services.

I put significant effort in supporting other engineers in Microsoft DirectShow and Windows Media Foundation technologies, current, past (and probably future) colleagues keep finding my online posts when solving daily challenges.
